# Web API Explorer App

This is the **Web API Explorer App**, a React-based application that allows users to explore various APIs provided by different providers. The app lists APIs in an accordion-style interface, enabling users to browse APIs from multiple providers, view detailed information about each API, and navigate to specific API documentation.

The project is built using **React**, **React Router**, **styled-components**, and **TypeScript** with **Webpack** as the module bundler.
